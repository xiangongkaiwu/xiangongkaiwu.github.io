# Chapter 336: Divine Sense Contest

Lifting his head, Ning Zhuo first glanced at the Fog Shrouded Mountain towering between heaven and earth, and then at Sun Lingtong. Seeing the latter’s indifferent attitude, he nodded to the patrolwoman and said, “Alright.”

Although his military might was at the Golden Core level, the incident in the Lava Immortal Palace hadn’t been over for long, and its various lessons were still fresh in his mind.

Ning Zhuo was cautious by nature.

Since it was said that the mountain was dangerous at night, what was the harm in going with the flow and spending the night in the mountain village?

“Distinguished guests, please come with me.” The patrolwoman smiled brightly and took the initiative to lead the way.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong followed her into the village.

Soon after, they met one of the village elders, who immediately arranged for the two of them to stay in guest rooms at the center of the mountain village. Ning Zhuo took out twenty spirit stones to pay for their expenses, then requested to meet over tea and talk about Fog Shrouded Mountain.

The village elder naturally accepted his request.

This was to be expected.

The patrolwoman had changed her mind and invited Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong into the village as soon as she saw Ning Zhuo proactively paying her a spirit stone.

“Two distinguished guests, this is Fog Shrouded Mountain’s special Fog Shrouded Tea. Although it can’t compare with those famous teas out there, it has its own unique points.” The village elder took the initiative to start talking.

Ning Zhuo picked up the teacup and saw that the tea leaves were dark green. In addition, there were curls of gray fog rising up from the surface of the tea.

The tea was bitter at first taste, lingering on the tip of the tongue like a thick mountain fog. However, this bitterness soon passed and turned into a sweet aftertaste. It was like the refreshing tranquility of a mountain after the fog disappeared.

“Not bad, it has a unique flavor.” Ning Zhuo offered some light praise.

Next to him, Sun Lingtong didn’t move.

On the one hand, he had never had any interest in elegant hobbies like drinking tea. For him, drinking tea was merely to quench his thirst.

And on the other hand, since Ning Zhuo had taken a drink, he himself wouldn’t partake. After all, they were traveling around outside. This was a tacit understanding between him and Ning Zhuo.

The three people chatted over tea, allowing Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong to gradually gain a rough understanding of this mountain village.

There were around 300 households in the village and about 1,500 people in total. The strongest person here was the village chief in the late stage of Foundation Establishment. There were also six village elders, all of whom had had Foundation Establishment stage cultivation at their peak. Among them, some had been seriously injured, causing their cultivation bases to fall to the Qi Refining stage, but their achievements still garnered the respect and awe of all the villagers.

When the village elder mentioned the village chief, Sun Lingtong asked where he was. The village elder explained that the village chief had gone out with a group of people to deliver food.

As it turned out, eight hundred li away from Fog Shrouded Mountain, there was a place called Jade Steel Mountain.

This mountain was rich in jade-glossed black steel. Many years ago, the Southern Bean Kingdom had opened a heavily-guarded mine there, and eventually, a mountain town appeared.

Over the years, the number of people in the mountain town gradually increased. However, Jade Steel Mountain was barren and could never become self-sustaining.

Thus, the Southern Bean Kingdom issued a decree for the people of the nearby villages to continuously send excess supplies to Jade Steel Town.

The mountain villages were very willing to cooperate. When they brought supplies to Jade Steel Town, they could exchange for other goods. Although they didn’t reap too much of a profit, they could aid the development of their own villages while fulfilling the royal decree; it was a win-win situation.

As the night deepened, Ning Zhuo took the initiative to get up first. After bidding farewell to the village elder, he and Sun Lingtong left, flying around and checking out the nighttime mountain village.

Of course, there were patrollers stationed around their residence. However, how could these mountain villagers track down Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo? Sun Lingtong was born with a powerful background and excelled at thievery. As for Ning Zhuo, he had the Cloud Concealment Bud in his body. This exotic plant could even hide him from Golden Core stage cultivators, never mind these patrolling villagers.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo jumped from roof to roof. As the cool night breeze blew against their faces, Sun Lingtong said, “Hehehe, feels great! Little Zhuo, this is the taste of freedom!”

He had grown tired of staying in Fire Persimmon Immortal City a long time ago. If not for his worry for his master, and later his concern for Ning Zhuo, someone with Sun Lingtong’s personality would have already left to wander the world.

Ning Zhuo was also smiling.

He had lived in Fire Persimmon Immortal City since birth, and for the past fourteen years, he had put in vast amounts of effort to obtain the Lava Immortal Palace.

Now, the matters of the Immortal Palace had temporarily come to an end, allowing him to put down the huge stone in his heart and heavy burden on his shoulders. He felt quite happy as he pranced about in the night breeze.

Soon, the two stopped after finding a high vantage point.

Sun Lingtong sent a voice transmission, saying, “Little Zhuo, let’s have a competition. How about we test how far we can spread our divine sense? I won’t take advantage of you; I’ll suppress my cultivation to the early stage of Foundation Establishment.”

Ning Zhuo replied, “Since you’re so enthusiastic, boss, I won’t let you down.”

"Hehehe." Sun Lingtong laughed a few times and immediately spread his divine sense.

Ten zhang, thirty zhang, sixty zhang…

In the end, his divine sense reached 260 zhang before stopping.

At this point, his divine sense covered more than half the village. After quietly investigating for a moment, he immediately withdrew it.

It took only three breaths for his divine sense to return.

But more importantly, the whole process, from the spreading of his divine sense to its retrieval, was perfectly well hidden. Even Ning Zhuo, who was standing right next to Sun Lingtong, couldn’t feel a thing.

Now, it was Ning Zhuo’s turn. He slowly began to spread his own divine sense.

Ten zhang, twenty zhang, forty zhang…

When his divine sense expanded to 180 zhang, he was unable to spread it any further.

Just a bit more than half the mountain village was in the range of Ning Zhuo’s divine sense. The villagers were unaware and hadn’t made any preparations, allowing Ning Zhuo to bear witness to the insides of their homes. He even caught some villagers in the middle of nighttime activities.

Ning Zhuo discovered that most of the villagers worshiped a mountain god in their home. Eighty percent of the tablets, portraits, or small shrines were dedicated to the fox god, with only twenty percent worshiping the tiger god. In other words, the tiger god, which was supposed to be the real god, was considered secondary.

Ning Zhuo carefully retrieved his divine sense.

When he released his divine sense, he was several times slower than Sun Lingtong. Now, when he took it back, he was even slower – dozens of times slower compared to his compatriot.

Sun Lingtong, who had been watching Ning Zhuo’s performance, frowned slightly.

“Little Zhuo, although my cultivation base is higher than yours, your divine sea dantian was cultivated through the method of the Three Schools Supreme Sage. Why is your divine sense only 180 zhang? You aren’t hiding your strength, are you?”

Ning Zhuo immediately shook his head and said, "Boss, this is my full strength."

Sun Lingtong was confused. “How could that be? An average Foundation Establishment cultivator can spread their divine sense at least 150 zhang. The Mirror Platform Spirit Channeling Art only gives you 180 zhang? It doesn’t make sense.”

Ning Zhuo smiled lightly and took the initiative to clear Sun Lingtong’s doubts. “Boss, you don’t know about this, but the Mirror Platform Spirit Channeling Art needs to pair with external objects in order to reveal its true strength.

“According to the information I received from the transmission bell, I need to refine submirrors. Each submirror can project my divine sense a further distance. Depending on the grade of the submirror, its effects will be increased even more.

“If I had enough split mirrors, I could cover the entire Fog Shrouded Mountain. However, after being projected over multiple submirrors, my divine sense will become very weak, only allowing me to vaguely sense its surroundings.”

Sun Lingtong’s frown faded. "So that was it."

Only now did he feel relieved.

Just now, he had wanted to use the excuse of a competition to help improve Ning Zhuo’s mastery over divine sense. After all, Ning Zhuo had only just advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage, while Sun Lingtong was already in the late stage of Foundation Establishment.

Qi Refining cultivators only had spirit intent, which couldn’t leave the body. Even when reading a jade slip, they had to place the jade slip between their brows.

At the Foundation Establishment stage, spirit intent was condensed and sublimated to form divine sense. Divine sense allowed a cultivator to sense things beyond their body, and in the early stage of Foundation Establishment, it generally had a range of 150 zhang.

For cultivators who specialized in the divine sea dantian, the range of their divine sense would surpass 150 zhang once they reached the Foundation Establishment stage. The more powerful their cultivation method, the greater the range would be.

After suppressing his cultivation to the early stage of Foundation Establishment, Sun Lingtong’s divine sense could sense everything in a range of 260 zhang. But the Mirror Platform Spirit Channeling Art that came from the Three Schools Supreme Sage only had a range of 180 zhang. This was far lower than Sun Lingtong’s expectations.

Now that he heard Ning Zhuo’s explanation, he felt relieved.

The Mirror Platform Spirit Channeling Art was different from other techniques in that it needed to be paired with external objects in order to bring out its true strength.

Ever since the world of cultivation began, countless mystical techniques had appeared. Some techniques could turn the divine sense ethereal, some could make it extremely penetrating, and some could even turn it into a means of attack.

The fact that the Mirror Platform Spirit Channeling Art’s divine sense had to be paired with external objects was a bit strange, but it was also logical. After all, the Three Schools Supreme Sage placed great focus on mechanical arts. It made sense that his techniques would rely on external objects.

After their reconnaissance, the pair quietly returned to their guest rooms.

None of the villagers noticed a thing.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong each lay on their own bed, sending their divine sense through the walls and secretly communicating with each other.

When they talked about the number of tablets worshiping the Tiger God and Fox God, Sun Lingtong guessed: “The Tiger God and Fox God have both been officially recognized by the Southern Bean Kingdom. Enjoying the joss flames from their worship can greatly improve their strength.

“But it seems that the Tiger God is too weak. Otherwise, it couldn’t remain indifferent while the Fox God harvests all the joss flames.

“Could it be that it’s been suppressed?”

The modern cultivation world was ruled by humans and gods.

Humanity was the primary race, while gods were scattered all around the world.

After a cultivation kingdom was established, it would often suppress mountains and subdue temples within its borders, suppressing the various gods. Some gods were unyielding and would be slaughtered completely. Others surrendered, becoming official gods that were encouraged by the court.

Every cultivation kingdom needed gods to increase the kingdom’s ruling power.

Compared to humans, the various gods were often more simple-minded. They could endure extreme environments, and use their divine powers to call the wind and summon the rain, diverting waters and opening mountains.

After a god joined the cultivation kingdom, it would be able to absorb joss flames on a wide scale, commune with the outside world, and cultivate further with the help of the nation’s fate energy.

This was a relationship of mutual benefit.
