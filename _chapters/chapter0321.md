# Chapter 321: The Monk Doctor, Meng Yaoyin (Start of the Grand Finale, Vote for Monthly Tickets!)

Fourteen years ago.

As Meng Yaoyin lay dying, she gave some final advice to her two-year-old son, Ning Zhuo.

“The immortal city is in continuous decline, and the standards for selection are lowering with it. Zhuo’er, by the time you turn fourteen, the selection threshold for the city of mechanisms will drop to the Qi Refining stage. This will be your greatest opportunity!"

"Zhuo’er, you must diligently study the arts of mechanisms. Design the constructs yourself, assemble them with your own hands, and control them personally. These will all be part of the assessment in the city."

“Never advance to the Foundation Establishment stage using the Ning family’s cultivation method!”

“Do not let others know about your dedication to this. Don’t stand out too much. Your father and I are no longer here, and no one can be your true support. You must hide yourself well. Don’t be too exceptional, but don’t be too mediocre either. Grow quietly, accumulate in silence, and avoid drawing attention.”

“I’ve seen too many geniuses die young…”

"I leave you the Cang Iron Armor for protection—it carries the might of the Foundation Establishment stage.”

"And this treasure—the Buddha Heart Demon Seal! I was lucky enough to obtain it from the Lava Immortal Palace. You must never reveal it.”

After saying these things, in her final moments, Meng Yaoyin hesitated again. "I don’t know if teaching you this way is truly right.”

“Zhuo’er, take good care of yourself. If things get too hard, give up on the Lava Immortal Palace.”

“Life comes first. I just want you to live—live well.”

“If you’re alive, I’ll be happy.”

Two-year-old Ning Zhuo clutched his mother’s blood-soaked clothes tightly, crying, “Mother, mother, please stop. I don’t want you to die! Don’t die, please!”

In her last breath, Meng Yaoyin whispered, “My precious Zhuo’er, don’t be afraid… Mother will always watch over you from the ground...”

In the next moment, her heart stopped, and her hand slipped slowly from Ning Zhuo’s head.

He froze in shock, whispering, “Mother… Mother, wake up… please wake up!”

Then, his voice rose into a scream as he threw himself into her lifeless arms, wailing bitterly.

He cried until he passed out.

Meng Yaoyin’s soul let out a faint sigh as it drifted out of her body.

She reached out to touch Ning Zhuo, but her hand passed through him.

She formed a hand seal, using her puppet-controlling technique to make her own corpse stand up.

From her storage bracelet, she pulled out a prepared substitute corpse, placing it where her body had been.

Before leaving, she knelt down, gazing at Ning Zhuo’s sleeping face with deep reluctance.

After a moment, she pushed down her emotions, controlling her body to descend into a secret underground chamber and leave through a teleportation array.

She first teleported to a hidden base underground, using it as a transfer point before heading to Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Familiar with the path, she followed the tunnel and entered the Lava Immortal Palace once more.

Guided by the palace's glow, she found her way inside.

It was her first time entering the palace after her death, and her emotions were complicated.

Her former rank allowed her smooth passage into the Gourd Furnace Forest.

Her soul emitted faint purple scars, and she sighed, “Even after death, this Dao wound remains. I can only hope refining my spirituality can heal it!”

But the Dao wound continued to affect her, weakening her quickly as she struggled to control her corpse and climb into the golden furnace.

The Cremation of Brahma Sutra!

The flames rose, subjecting Meng Yaoyin to the agonizing pain of soul-burning and spirit-refining. Yet, she endured it in complete silence, sitting quietly in the furnace, her willpower unshakable.

"Zhuo’er, Zhuo’er, if I succeed, I can still watch you grow up.”

“If not…”

She smiled sadly, but there was no trace of doubt in her resolve.

Regardless of the outcome, her soul would dissipate. She could have gone to the underworld, where her remaining lifespan would allow her to live longer. But for her son, she took this immense risk, refining herself.

In the shadows, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit watched in shock.

"Too ruthless… This woman is too ruthless!”

The golden furnace shattered, and the Monk Doctor descended. The refined spirituality of Meng Yaoyin entered her mechanical body.

The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit marveled, "She actually succeeded!"

“She endured such excruciating pain without uttering a sound. When I went through this, I screamed… no, I roared from start to finish.”

“She truly proves that only those ruthless enough can become demons!”

Watching Meng Yaoyin leave the palace, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit smiled contentedly. "This Meng Yaoyin is truly my benefactor!"

"Not only did she exploit the loopholes and take away the Buddha Heart Demon Seal, but even after her death, she claimed the Monk Doctor. Truly impressive."

“I hope more like her appear in the future.”

“With a few more like her, my escape from this place would be within reach!”

The Monk Doctor, Meng Yaoyin, retraced her steps and returned to Ning Zhuo.

She reached out with her mechanical hand and gently stroked his cheek.

Then, she activated the mechanisms within her body.

Warm Buddha light, like the glow of sunlight or flowing water, poured out from her body and entered Ning Zhuo's upper Dantian, into his Divine Sea.

“Zhuo’er, Mother has a gift for you.”

“This is the full Mirror Platform Communion Sutra, one of the three top sect methods!”

“I’ve hidden the entire scripture within your Divine Sea. When you cultivate this technique in the future, you will face no obstacles.”

Having completed this, the Monk Doctor Meng Yaoyin quietly vanished from sight.

Arrangements were made for her burial: changing her shroud, setting up the hall, notifying the temple, issuing the obituary, preparing the spirit hall... the funeral rites, the condolences, the mourning vigil, and finally, the burial.

Meng Yaoyin, as the Monk Doctor, watched everything unfold from the shadows, witnessing her own funeral. Her heart was heavy as she saw the puppet-like, emotionless Ning Zhuo, and the pain tore at her soul.

She hesitated, torn between the urge to reunite and the fear of causing more harm.

The Dao wound!

She needed to confirm she was truly free of it. Otherwise, even if they reunited, it would only lead to more heartache and separation.

The Monk Doctor, Meng Yaoyin, stopped her breathing exercises, her eyes flickering with a brief hint of purple.

"Dao wound..." Her heart filled with regret.

Even after refining her spirituality, she could not escape the curse of this relentless wound.

"So, how much longer do I have this time?"

She smiled bitterly, grateful that she hadn’t revealed herself to Ning Zhuo again.

Late at night.

"Mother, mother, where are you? Please don’t leave me..." Two-year-old Ning Zhuo huddled in his bed, trembling from a nightmare.

Meng Yaoyin revealed herself.

Suppressing her sorrow, she quietly walked to his bedside, kneeling down and gently taking his small hand in hers.

She sang softly:

“The clouds fly, the clouds fly, flying over white rivers and emerald peaks. The stream meanders around the great tree, sunlight covering the grassy knolls.

The clouds fly, the wind chases, flying over rivers and stars. The sky so vast, the clouds roll freely, moved by the breeze.”

As the familiar lullaby echoed, Ning Zhuo’s furrowed brow relaxed, and he drifted into peaceful sleep.

This happened night after night.

Then, one evening, before Meng Yaoyin could start the lullaby, Ning Zhuo awoke from his nightmare with a start.

He saw a puppet standing at the foot of his bed, and screamed in terror.

“Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, it’s me, your mother,” the Monk Doctor, Meng Yaoyin, hastened to reassure him gently.

But Ning Zhuo shrank back against the wall, wrapping himself in his blanket, trembling with fear.

Meng Yaoyin’s heart broke. She reached out instinctively to comfort him, only to see her mechanical hand.

Her heart trembled, and she pulled back her hand, sitting down at the bedside.

Softly, she began to sing once more. “The clouds fly, the clouds fly…”

The song drew Ning Zhuo in. Mustering his courage, he peeked out from a small gap in his blanket, slowly widening it until he finally poked his head out.

He stared at the Monk Doctor in a daze, gradually recognizing her as his mother.

Tears welled in his eyes, and when the song ended, he threw off the blanket and ran straight into her arms.

Crying, he shouted, “Mother!”

“Zhuo’er, my precious Zhuo’er.” Meng Yaoyin held him close, stroking his head, her heart full of emotion, though her tears never fell.

With their reunion, Meng Yaoyin no longer held back, secretly caring for and teaching Ning Zhuo every day.

She primarily taught him the arts of mechanisms.

Only after losing it, did she realize how precious time with him was.

Ning Zhuo clung tightly to Meng Yaoyin, listening intently to every word she said.

“Mother, mother,” Ning Zhuo called softly.

Meng Yaoyin snapped out of her thoughts.

Ning Zhuo curled up in her arms, looking up at her with innocent eyes, his voice soft, “You’re distracted during class, Mother. That won’t do.”

Meng Yaoyin bent down, kissed his forehead gently, and whispered an apology. Yet, the shadows in her heart grew deeper.

She knew this was the work of the Dao wound.

At first, the wound was barely noticeable in her spirituality. But soon, faint traces of purple appeared.

Now, that purple had become strands, coiling ever tighter.

The past was repeating itself, and Meng Yaoyin knew her time was once again running short.

Her heart filled with sadness and uncertainty. She didn’t know how to explain the truth to Ning Zhuo.

One night, a sneaky figure appeared near the Ning family residence.

Meng Yaoyin acted decisively.

Thud.

The figure fell to the ground.

Ning Zhuo witnessed the scene, his face turning pale, stammering, “M-Mother, did you kill him?”

Meng Yaoyin shook her head. “He was acting suspiciously and has cultivation. Likely a petty thief. But he’s not dead, just knocked unconscious.”

Ning Zhuo looked at the unconscious figure, his shock giving way to sympathy and concern. “He’s just a child, like me.”

“Mother, if we leave him here, won’t he bleed to death?”

Meng Yaoyin smiled. “Do you want to save him?”

“Yes!” Ning Zhuo nodded eagerly.

Meng Yaoyin, knowing her time was short, decided to use this chance to teach Ning Zhuo a profound lesson. “Then it’s up to you. But since you want to save him, you must do it yourself. Don’t rely on me.”

Ning Zhuo’s face lit up with joy. “Thank you, Mother!”

He quickly dragged Sun Lingtong into the courtyard.
