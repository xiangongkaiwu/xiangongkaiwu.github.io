# Chapter 330: Family Division Ceremony
A few more days passed.


The Zheng family's land — no the Ning family's branch land—changed from a color of white to fiery red. The sadness and mourning faded away mostly, and there was an atmosphere of joy everywhere.


Ning Zhuo stood on the high platform, first offering sacrifices to the heavens, then to the earth, and finally burning paper money, lighting incense, and informing the ancestors in the underworld that he, Ning Zhuo, would officially split from the main family today, at this moment!


"Today is the grand ceremony of the division of the family... I have received great help from you all... I am grateful and will remember it in my heart."


"From today on, as the clan leader, I will be determined to be diligent and dedicated and take the family's prosperity as my responsibility!"


"Today's achievements were not achieved overnight, nor could they be accomplished by one person. Here, I especially need to remember the martyrs for the family, Ning Xiaohui, Ning Xiangguo, Ning Xiaoren and many others! You shed blood on the battlefield for the family and protected the dignity and safety of the family with your lives. Although your heroic souls are gone, your spirits live on. We will always remember their kindness and vow to strengthen the family and comfort your souls in heaven..."


"...I will inherit the will of the martyrs, remain loyal, and defend the peace of my family. I will never tolerate the evil deeds of the Void Sect and other treacherous people. All evil will be eradicated. I will set an example, forge ahead, and never retreat."


"...My family elders have deep feelings of loyalty. I will never forget them. I will always be grateful and do my best to give back to my family. I will be loyal and serve the City Lord's Mansion and the South Bean Kingdom. I am willing to protect the peace of this place with my sincere heart."


"...Thank you all for joining us in this great cause. I hope we can all work together to build our family and achieve great things!"


Ning Zhuo's inspiring speech excited countless disciples of the Ning family branch, who had all suffered from the main branch for a long time.


There were also guests invited to watch the ceremony, and when they saw Ning Zhuo on the podium, they all had complicated expressions.


Some were envious, some were jealous, some were wary, some looked down on them... Behind the main hall of the division family, a grand banquet was set up to entertain guests from all over.


The former Zheng family land had a new owner. The Zheng family members were either imprisoned or taken away by the Purple Dawn Pavilion, while the members of the Ning family enjoyed the wine and food here.


The atmosphere is lively with food and drinks, where rise and fall blend together. However, the cruelty of the rise and fall of these people made those who noticed feel cold in their hearts.


The seating arrangement was carefully designed.


At the main table, Wang Lan sat in the highest position. Ning Zhuo served her, often picking up dishes for her and showing great concern for her.


Wang Lan found the food tasteless, and she began to sob again while eating.


Ning Zhuo quickly put down his chopsticks and asked gently.


Wang Lan was extremely sad, lamenting that such a beautiful moment was like a dream, but her husband and beloved son fell in the darkness before dawn. She did not enjoy this moment, which made her very sad.


Ning Zhuo tried to comfort them at that time, and his words were like gentle breeze and drizzle, which made the guests who witnessed this scene secretly praise and feel moved.


At the tables next to the main table were many widows and orphans.


After Ning Zhuo persuaded Wang Lan to stop, he left the main table and personally took Ning Chen, Ning Yong, and others to toast each table in turn.


The first table is the neighboring table.


The orphans and widows were worried, so Ning Zhuo announced publicly that the descendants of meritorious officials would not be treated unfairly and that a branch school would be set up to provide free education for these orphans.


Such a benevolent policy immediately moved the widows so much that their eyes reddened and they shed tears. One of them took the initiative to kneel down with her children to express her gratitude, and then all the orphans and widows at the table knelt down to express their gratitude.


“Why has it come to this?” Ning Zhuo’s eyes also turned red. He helped them up one by one and sat down again.


The guests praised him highly, saying that although Ning Zhuo was young, he had the appearance of a master.


The commotion was so loud that it attracted almost everyone's attention.


The receptionist suddenly sang: "The elders of Ning Family Academy are here to congratulate you!"


Immediately, he recited the gift list: "10,000 top-grade spirit stones, 3,000 kilograms of red sun copper, 136 groups of foundation-building earthly evil fire, 80 ginsengs of 200 years old..."


The gift list is quite long.


Ning Zhuo quickly stood up, respectfully addressed the teacher, and welcomed the academy elder to the main table.


Among the many elders of the Ning family, the academy elder has the closest relationship with Ning Zhuo. After all, Ning Zhuo just graduated from the school this year.


After the academy elder sat down, he took Ning Zhuo's hand, smiled kindly, and spoke kindly.


Ning Zhuo had no choice but to sit next to the school elder, chatting and laughing.


Those who didn't know the truth thought that the academy elder and Ning Zhuo had a good personal relationship. In fact, the academy elder didn't even teach any of Ning Zhuo’s classes.Ning Zhuo didn't see the academy elder more than ten times a year.


The academy elder came to show goodwill on behalf of the main branch of the Ning family, which Ning Zhuo welcomed. Showing closeness at this moment would also benefit the future of the branch family.


Ning Zhuo clearly knew why the Ning family's main branch changed its attitude.


He was not aware of Ning Jiufan’s punishment of Ning Qingqiao and the threat to the head of the Ning family.


The elders who experienced this matter were all very secretive. Even Ning Jiufan was no exception.


However, Ning Qingqiao was stripped of his position as elder, a major event that had to be announced to the public.


"To deprive a family elder of his position, other family elders cannot do it together. Now the position of the Ning family head is vacant, and the source of the drastic change in the position of the family elder can only come from Ning's submission. There is no other choice."


Ning Zhuo's branch family had just been established, and for now, it needed a peaceful external environment. Ning Zhuo secretly made a plan: He could always cause trouble for the main branch of the Ning family in the future. The most important thing now was for the branch family to gain a firm foothold.


"The ancestor of the Zhou family, Lord Zhou Nongying, has arrived--!" the receptionist chanted loudly, his voice trembling a little.


You know, this is a Jindan-level cultivator, one of the two ancestors of the Zhou family.


The establishment of the Ning family branch unexpectedly attracted such a heavyweight figure. This surprising change made everyone at the banquet immediately stand up and prepare to salute Zhou Nongying, who was about to take the table.


The receptionist continued to read out Zhou Nongying's gift list.


"Forty foundation-building fire snakes, thirty-two foundation-building spirit-gathering array plates, and four hundred and forty-six kilograms of moonlight cold iron!"


Although Zhou Nongying's gift list was much shorter than that of the main branch of the Ning family, each


The items are all heavyweight.


This surprised everyone even more: the Zhou family attached so much importance to the separation of the little Ning Zhuo. Not only did the Jindan Patriarch take the initiative to congratulate him, but he also gave him such a valuable gift. I can't figure it out. Ah, I really can't figure it out.


This feeling is like a noble bringing a large sum of money to a beggar to celebrate.


In the eyes of the public, Zhou Nongying's personal attendance alone would bring honor and pride to Ning Zhuo for the rest of his life.


The key point is that Zhou Nongying not only came, but also brought a valuable gift.


"This is really giving Ning Zhuo some face! Hahahaha, my branch family will be prosperous in no time."


"Humph, what do you know? Ning Zhuo is just a puppet, a figurehead who is supported on the stage. All he can do is laugh. Zhou Nongying is obviously trying to show his good will to Ancestor Ning Jiufan."


"You understand everything!"


The guests argued in low voices, but Zhou Nongying never showed up.


Instead, Ning Zhuo said goodbye to the academy with an apologetic look on his face, and ran out of the banquet hall. Obviously, he was going to meet Zhou Nongying.


The guests eagerly waited, hoping that Ning Zhuo would bring Zhou Nongying over.


Unfortunately, no matter how hard they waited, he showed up. After asking, they found out that Ning Zhuo had already taken Zhou Nongying into a separate room and he would not be seated with the others.


So the next moment, everyone sighed, revealing their regret.


After entering the room, only Ning Zhuo and Zhou Nongying were present. Ning Zhuo straightened his back, and his smile became reserved. He thanked Zhou Nongying for his equal support.


Zhou Nongying personally participated in the third round of the palace examination and knew Ning Zhuo's strength. Apart from other things, the Buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin with the Night Rain Demon Weapon especially made the second ancestor of the Zhou family deeply afraid.


Zhou Nongying first praised Ning Zhuo, saying that Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu had greatly praised Ning Zhuo. He used this to make the Zhou family's attitude clear: They were very willing to get close to Ning Zhuo's branch family, even more so than the main Ning family.


"Unfortunately, the bodies of Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu were not found." Ning Zhuo thought of this.


He secretly felt sorry for it.


These two rising stars of the Zhou family did not die at the hands of Ning Zhuo.


When he entered the main hall through the teleportation gate, he found that Zhou Zeshen and Zhou Zhu had been killed. They both died at the hands of Meng Chong!


Without letting Ning Zhuo speak, Zhou Nongying took the initiative to propose that the Zhou family was willing to send out the most outstanding formation-setting monks to modify and upgrade various formations for Ning Zhuo's branch family, such as the formations in the major refining rooms.


Ning Zhuo looked pleased and immediately said that close cooperation with the Zhou family was a good thing that everyone in the branch family was looking forward to.


Everyone knew about the Zhou family's skills in setting up formations. The Zheng family once offered a high price and invited the Zhou family to improve their formations, but the Zhou family declined.


This would greatly help the Zheng family, especially the large and small arrays in the weapon refining room. Once these arrays are improved, it would make the Zheng family far stronger!


But this time, Zhou Nongying took the initiative to cooperate with Ning Zhuo on this matter, which shows the sincerity of the Zhou family.


Ning Zhuo knew the situation very well: "On the one hand, my combat power is beyond the limit, and I cannot treat it as a Qi Refining Cultivator at all. On the other hand, the Meng family is in charge of the Lava Immortal Palace, and the Zhou family is under the greatest pressure. We urgently need allies to fight against the Meng family together."


After settling the Lava Immortal Palace incident, the entire Fire Persimmon City changed dramatically.


The Zhou family is indeed an old family and has already taken active actions in response to major changes.


While talking with Zhou Nongying, the receptionist sang: "Master Fei Si from the City Lord's Mansion has arrived.


Fei Si also brought a lot of gifts.


Everyone at the banquet was shocked again.


Compared to Zhou Nongying, Fei Si is the acting city lord, a capable subordinate of the city lord Meng Kui, and the real big shot who ruled the city.


And now, such a big shot actually came to congratulate him in person!


“Am I hallucinating?”


“This is unbelievable!”


"What virtue and ability does little Ning Zhu have?!"


Faith was not seated either.


Ning Zhuo had to temporarily interrupt his communication with Zhou Nongying and go out to greet Fei Si.


Zhou Nongying sneered in his heart, and said with a smile: "Let's welcome you together, let's welcome you together."


When Fei Si saw Ning Zhuo and Zhou Nongying coming over simultaneously, he smiled meaningfully: "Clan Leader Ning Zhuo, it seems that I have disturbed you."


Ning Zhuo bowed and saluted Fei Si, expressing his gratitude for Fei Si's care for him in the past.


Fei Si narrowed his eyes, looked Ning Zhuo up and down, and sighed: "Clan Leader Ning Zhuo, you are too kind. Without me, your strength was more than enough to overcome all kinds of difficulties. It is I, Fei Si, who did not recognize a hero!"


He was truly speaking from the heart.


After learning the truth from Meng Kui, he was completely shocked.


Hedidn't expect Ning Zhuo, this young man, to hide so deeply and plan so sinisterly and viciously. The destruction of the entire Zheng family was basically due to him!


Fei Si admired Ning Zhuo more, but he also became extremely wary and defensive.
