# Chapter 335: Fog Shrouded Mountain

Myriad Li Wandering Dragon!

Inside the cultivation chamber, Ning Zhuo floated cross-legged in midair.

Sun Lingtong stood behind him, also floating, the palm of his meaty little hand pressed against Ning Zhuo’s back.

Ning Zhuo was currently practicing the Three Schools Supreme Arts.

First was the Mirror Platform Spirit Channeling Art, then the Five Elements Qi Controlling Art, and finally the Demonic Blood Vein Technique.

Sometimes, his demeanor was dignified and his face radiated a Buddhist light; sometimes, his five qis circulated in tandem; sometimes, his aura was bloody and full of demonic intent.

Sun Lingtong’s divine sense penetrated Ning Zhuo’s body, observing his three dantians.

He saw that the upper dantian was clear of blemishes, and above and below were two flat, smooth expanses. They were like two gigantic mirrors forming heaven and earth.

Between these two mirrors, there were smaller mirrors floating quietly. All kinds of thoughts flickered among them, emerging within the mirrors before disappearing instantaneously.

This was the Bright Mirror Spiritual Light Dantian!

In Ning Zhuo’s middle dantian, there was a five-colored maelstrom, a tornado-like pillar spanning the distance between heaven and earth. This maelstrom contained the qis of the five elements: sometimes clear and distinct, sometimes blending into one, and sometimes changing constantly into each other again and again. The profundities of the mutual generation and restraint of the five elements were on full display.

This was the Five Qis Heavenly Pivot Dantian!

Ning Zhuo’s lower dantian was suffused with dense masses of blood that seemed to form crimson soil. This soil was covered in layers of crisscrossing blood veins, weaving together like a giant net.

Boundless blood energy could be found inside these blood veins. With every beat of Ning Zhuo’s heart, the blood energy inside the veins ebbed and flowed like a tide.

This was the Bloody Soil Demonic Vein Dantian!

Since Ning Zhuo had advanced to the Foundation Establishment stage, his three dantians were beginning to solidify, undergoing mysterious and profound transformations.

After the session of cultivation was complete, Ning Zhuo opened his eyes, and Sun Lingtong retracted his palm.

The magic formation was deactivated, and the two people fell to the ground.

Sun Lingtong immediately gushed in praise, “Wonderful, really wonderful. These three supreme arts are truly exquisite. Even a single one is already a cultivation technique of the highest grade.

“If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I would never have imagined that someone could cultivate all three at once. The Three Schools Supreme Sage is truly incredible! His achievements are enough to shake the heavens and shatter the earth.

“Your choice to endure for more than ten years just to fight for the Lava Immortal Palace was completely correct!

“Ol’ Zhuo, if you keep cultivating this, your future will be unlimited!”

Sun Lingtong was very honest.

Ning Zhuo nodded. “It’s a pity that the Dharma Transmission Bell only taught me the techniques for the Foundation Establishment stage. In the future, I’ll have to return to the Lava Immortal Palace to learn the Golden Core stage techniques.”

Sun Lingtong paused. “That is indeed a troublesome matter. You’ll have to be careful of the Meng family when you do that.”

“Boss, there’s something I don’t understand in the Demonic Blood Muscle Technique. It’s this part that talks about the unity of heart and Dharma.” Ning Zhuo took the chance to ask for advice.

Sun Lingtong rubbed his chin and said, “I haven’t practiced the supreme arts and only used my divine sense to watch you cultivate just now. That’s why I can only provide my own opinion, which isn’t necessarily correct.

“When it comes to cultivation, you can’t just think about the principles of the technique logically. You also need your own personal enlightenment, and to deepen your understanding of the technique through practice.

“Right now, you’re only in the Foundation Establishment stage, so advice from others can still have an effect. But once you reach the Golden Core stage, you’ll have to rely primarily on personal enlightenment.

“So, do you still want my help?”

Ning Zhuo immediately understood what Sun Lingtong was trying to say.

When it came to understanding cultivation techniques, cultivators would eventually reach a point where they had to rely on themselves. If he didn’t get into a habit of obtaining insights by himself in the early stages of cultivation, he would be at a disadvantage in the future!

“I’ll try to understand it myself first,” Ning Zhuo said.

Sun Lingtong clapped his hands. “Haha, you’ve made the right choice! Now come on, let’s take a look around this Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.”

The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon had the dragon’s spine running down its center, and there were numerous chambers located on either side.

The cultivation chamber that Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were currently in was one of them.

Aside from this control chamber, there was also a dragon’s head chamber, refinement chamber, storage chamber, furnace chamber, nursery chamber, etc.

Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo walked around and discovered that there was a great amount of fire essence in the storage chamber. The furnace chamber was filled with overwhelming heat that made it inaccessible. Although the refining chamber was open, neither Sun Lingtong nor Ning Zhuo dared to test it out. As for the nursery chamber, it was empty.

Finally, the two arrived at the chamber at the dragon’s head and saw the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit inside.

It was curled up into a ball and nestled inside a pearl-like bead.

This bead was the size of a small millstone. It was translucent, smooth, and perfectly round.

Ning Zhuo stretched out his hand and held the bead in his palm. In an instant, intricate formations appeared, spreading from the bead onto the walls and flowing along the dragon’s spine, awakening the various mechanisms of the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon mechanical construct.

Ning Zhuo activated one of the mechanisms, and a circular hole immediately appeared in the ceiling. A “psssh” came from the hole, and a small amount of air was expelled from the dragon’s head chamber before being refilled.

This was the pneumatic valve.

Once activated, it could adjust the airflow between the individual chambers. If there was a fire somewhere, the controller of the dragon could just expel all the air from the chamber to extinguish the flames.

“Whoa, that looks fun! Hey hey, let me have a turn.” Sun Lingtong’s heart itched as he watched Ning Zhuo play around with various mechanisms.

The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon could be considered an absolute masterpiece among mechanical constructs.

Not only was its battle prowess exceptional, it was also perfect for traveling long distances. The chambers of the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon could fulfill various functions and provide a stable cultivation environment for the cultivators riding it.

When Sun Lingtong took his turn, he activated the observation mechanism. In an instant, he and Ning Zhuo saw the scenes of the world outside the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.

Their surroundings were pitch-black. The only thing that could be seen were streaks of silver light piercing through the curtain of darkness around the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.

These silver streaks were sometimes sparse and sometimes dense. They occasionally grouped up into great masses of light.

“Is this how a Nascent Soul cultivator feels when they traverse the void?” Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo were momentarily stunned.

The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon was at the Nascent Soul level, and its best feature was that it could imitate Nascent Soul cultivators and enter the void to achieve long-distance teleportation.

As it approached its destination, the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon gradually slowed down. The silver streaks stopped fluctuating and quickly coalesced, merging with each other and eventually turning into the real world.

It was over in a flash.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong felt a heavy jolt inside the mechanical dragon. Both of them were in a daze, and it took them a moment to realize that the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon had landed among mountains.

Ning Zhuo immediately took out a jade slip containing a map, then sent his divine sense outward to investigate.

He discovered that the surrounding terrain was different from what was on the map.

The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon was freshly refined, so its routing information was completely empty. It had arrived here by following the general direction indicated on an external map jade slip.

Ning Zhuo had obtained this map jade slip from Ning Jiufan. It recorded the detailed terrain on the route that the Ning family had taken during its migration.

However, the map wasn’t perfectly accurate, so Ning Zhuo had to manually drive the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon, resulting in a delay.

There was no need to re-enter the void.

As small as a butterfly, the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon soared through the sky without catching any attention.

After eight and a half incense sticks’ worth of time, Ning Zhuo finally saw his location – Fog Shrouded Mountain!

This towering mountain was covered by clouds and mist.

Under the sunset, tall and straight pine trees could be seen among the clouds and mist. The gurgling of streams merged into a clear melody.

Back when the Ning family was migrating, they had been trapped in the labyrinth of the thick fog. It was only after eight days and seven nights passed that they finally escaped.

If Ning Zhuo wanted to cure Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin, he had to treat both the symptoms and the root cause of her malady.

He had no clue about the root cause, nor how he could fix it.

However, he did have a plan as to how he could treat the symptoms. His idea was to retrace the Ning family’s migration route and collect any relics Meng Yaoyin had left behind along the way.

He wanted to see if these relics could lead him to any clues about Meng Yaoyin’s identity or the origin of her Dao injury. Moreover, he could also sacrifice these relics to increase Buddhist Healer Meng Yaoyin’s spirituality and extend his window for healing her.

Controlling the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon, Ning Zhuo made a circle around Fog Shrouded Mountain at low altitude.

The Myriad Li Wandering Dragon was the size of a butterfly, and its restrained aura made it almost impossible to detect.

Soon, Ning Zhuo discovered a village at the foot of the mountain. After descending, he left the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon and changed its size, wrapping it around his waist like a belt.

He and Sun Lingtong disguised themselves and quickly walked over to the village.

When the female villager on patrol duty saw Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong, she immediately shouted at them to halt.

Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong both exuded their Foundation Establishment auras.

The patrolwoman was only in the Qi Refining stage and immediately felt a heavy pressure. However, she bravely stood her ground and blocked the pair.

Ning Zhuo quickly explained his intentions.

When she heard Ning Zhuo’s words, the patrolwoman gradually relaxed and replied, “Oh, you want to go to the mountain temple. Are you looking for the real temple or the fake one?”

A strange expression appeared on Ning Zhuo’s face. “This is Southern Bean Kingdom territory. If I recall correctly, the Southern Bean Kingdom has strictly forbidden superstitions and taken control of the mountain temples. How could there be a fake temple?”

Ning Zhuo wanted to search for relics of his mother, but it would be too difficult relying on just himself, Sun Lingtong, and the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon. After all, Fog Shrouded Mountain covered far too wide of an area.

Thus, the best method was to directly ask the mountain god.

The patrolwoman quickly explained, “The fake temple is also real. The mountain god enshrined there has already been verified by the royal family, so there’s no need to worry. It’s just that one is effective and the other almost never responds, so we call them real and fake to differentiate.”

Ning Zhuo asked the patrolwoman to explain in more detail, to which she replied, “The real temple is the Fox God Temple of the deputy mountain god, and the fake one is the Tiger God Temple of the main mountain god. The two temples are found to the south and north of Fog Shrouded Mountain, respectively.

Sun Lingtong was slightly surprised. “It’s said that ‘the fox exploits the tiger’s might’. But here on Fog Shrouded Mountain, the Fox God is the effective one while the Tiger God is unresponsive. What’s going on?”

“We’ll know once we take a look,” Ning Zhuo replied. Before leaving, he took out a spirit stone and gave it to the patrolwoman as payment.

“Thanks for clearing our confusion,” he said with a smile.

Taking the spirit stone and seeing that the two were about to leave, the patrolwoman hurriedly stopped them, saying, “Wait a minute, you two. Let me go check with the village chief and see if you can stay the night in the village.

“You know, the mountain isn’t safe at night. That’s when the fog is the thickest; many villagers have lost their way in the fog and eventually died.

“It’s not too late to wait for morning before going down the mountain.”
