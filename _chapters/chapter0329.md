# Chapter 329: This is the Righteous Path

Ning Zhuo's small courtyard.

A pair of mechanical arms, resembling ice crystals, sparkling and translucent, with elegant curves. The ten slender fingers were delicate, as smooth as jade, with symbols on the palms and backs resembling ice flowers, radiating a cold and holy aura.

This was a mechanical component known as the "Frost Jade Hands."

The true name—Ice Jade Hands!

A chill enveloped the healing monk, Meng Yaoyin, quickly freezing her.

To amplify the power, Ning Zhuo activated a temporary formation. The core of this formation was the Ice Heart Jade Pot, which he had specially borrowed from Ning Jiufan.

The combination of the Ice Jade Hands and the Ice Heart Jade Pot caused Meng Yaoyin to be encased in a massive block of ice. The wounds and indentations on her body began to heal rapidly.

After a full quarter-hour, the ice shattered and melted. Meng Yaoyin stood up without moving a muscle.

"How is it?" Sun Lingtong, who had been assisting in maintaining the formation, walked out, his face tense with concern.

Ning Zhuo carefully inspected the mechanical body of the puppet, noticing that the purple light mark within Meng Yaoyin's spirit still lingered, and the surface of her Golden Core was blooming with cloud-like patterns of purple.

He slowly shook his head.

Sun Lingtong let out a sigh.

Ning Zhuo, in turn, comforted him, "This outcome was something we anticipated, wasn't it?"

"My mother was a Golden Core cultivator when she was alive. Even after becoming a puppet after dying, she could still repel Zhu Xuanji in direct combat. She was extraordinary."

"She fell because of these injuries. We thought that using a single artifact and the innate talent could heal the wounds that claimed her life? That would be impossible."

Sun Lingtong nodded. "Yes, if it were that easy, your mother would have already taken the Ice Heart Jade Pot from Ning Jiufan herself to heal her wounds."

"Indeed," Ning Zhuo agreed. "But my mother was righteous person. How could she steal from others? If anything, she would have negotiated or borrowed it."

Ning Zhuo then joked with a wry smile, "But according to her actions in the Lava Immortal Palace, she did seem more like a villain."

"I understand your perspective," Sun Lingtong continued. "In your heart, your mother is obviously different from others."

Ning Zhuo gave a thoughtful nod in agreement. "You're right."

Then, Ning Zhuo looked at Sun Lingtong with an apologetic expression. "Brother Sun, I'm sorry. I've kept many things from you."

Sun Lingtong was surprised but quickly waved his hand dismissively, "Didn’t you already apologize before? It's not a big deal!"

He chuckled, placing his hands behind his head, "Honestly, I already guessed. The reason you saved me back then was because of my mother. She hit me pretty hard!"

"But it wasn’t without reason. I was trespassing on her family's territory."

"That explains why, at the critical moment of the Lava Immortal Palace battle, I suddenly developed mixed feelings of love and resentment towards her."

Ning Zhuo had previously revealed everything to Sun Lingtong when he handed over the Lava Immortal Palace to Meng Kui.

Hearing this, Sun Lingtong smirked. "You brat, keeping such a big secret from me, making me worry for no reason!"

Ning Zhuo, with a sincere expression, couldn’t help but stare at Sun Lingtong.

In response, Sun Lingtong simply shrugged and smiled, "Of course, I forgive you!"

Even now, after Ning Zhuo apologize again, Sun Lingtong  comforted him, "It’s not a big deal. You made me keep the secret, and that was your right."

"You did great, Brother Zhuo," Sun Lingtong said.

"Keeping things hidden is often the right way to succeed. If you hadn’t hidden it well, you wouldn’t have been able to achieve such a strong victory. You should continue to maintain this excellent habit!"

Ning Zhuo quickly assured Sun Lingtong that he would keep up his careful ways and even praised Sun Lingtong teachings.

Sun Lingtong placed his hands on his hips, laughing playfully. "Brat! Do you think flattery will make me happy?"

Though Sun Lingtong  raised Ning Zhuo, he felt no jealousy towards him. As a nurturing elder brother figure, he genuinely felt proud and gratified by Sun Lingtong’s accomplishments.

At that moment, Ning Chen arrived at the door to report that the formal transfer of the Zheng family land had been completed.

Ning Zhuo straightened up, "Alright, it’s time to handle some business. Go with Yang Chanyu to survey the Zheng family land again. See if you can find any hidden storages or flaws and report back to me."

It turned out that the Zheng family land had been divided among Ning Zhuo, Meng Kui, and Sun Lingtong according to their agreement.

As per the agreement, the Zheng family land was handed over to become the Ning family’s branch territory.

Sun Lingtong quietly left the scene. On the surface, Ning Zhuo had severed ties with Sun Lingtong and the Void Sect, so he had to avoid suspicion.

The perception that this severance had taken root was thanks to Zhu Xuanji's testimony, which had earned deep trust.

In their view, “entry standard” meant Sun Lingtong.

He seized the Lava Immortal Palace, letting people like Zhu Xuanji and others gather key information.

Even though Zhu Xuanji and some other cultivators had been delayed in the Secret Pavilion, Ning Zhuo managed to work in secret with Sun Lingtong, who also benefited from this hidden advantage.

Even if the truth was revealed, who would believe it?

Would they suspect Sun Lingtong, or Ning Zhuo?

Such is the way of the righteous path.

When Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu reached the Zheng family land, they saw Ning Yong and others replacing the old nameplate on the entrance with the Ning family’s.

People watching from behind the small gate quietly discussed the change.

"It's done! They really replaced it with the Ning family's nameplate!"

The spread of this information wasn’t orchestrated by Sun Lingtong.

"I heard this is the Ning family's branch land. Did you know the branch leader is Ning Zhuo?"

"Ning Zhuo? I think I’ve heard that name before."

"Yes, he’s a Ning family genius. He’s not even eighteen yet!"

"What? Only eighteen? How much cultivation could he have at that age?"

"Just mid-stage Qi Refinement."

"And he’s already leading a family branch?"

"It’s just a branch of the family, one that’s been oppressed for years. You’ve heard about the disputes between the Ning family’s main and branch lines, right?"

"So how did he get the position of branch leader? It doesn’t make sense!"

"Maybe the Ning family made a big move here. They took the Zheng family’s land and made a quick grab for it!"

"The reason for the branch formation seems suspicious. Could Ning Zhuo just be a figurehead?"

Their discussion reflected the belief that what they saw was the full truth, but in reality, the true power struggles were far more complex and brutal, hidden behind layers of righteous facade.

Thus, Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu searched through the Zheng family’s land but found no hidden storage, only numerous old flaws in the formation, many of which had been altered after the territory’s transfer.

All these findings were reported to Sun Lingtong.

The family’s formation would need to be redesigned, and all these vulnerabilities fixed. Ning Zhuo knew he was about to officially establish himself, and showing a bit of strength would reduce future threats.

The greatest asset of the Zheng family’s land was its superior refining and forging conditions, unmatched even by the City Lord's Mansion.

Ning Zhuo presided over a public ritual in the Zheng family’s territory, delivering an emotional eulogy:

"Heaven sheds no tears, the winds and clouds grow dull. Today, we gather to mourn our fallen kin."

"Dear ancestors—Ning Xiaoren, Ning Ze, Ning Xiangguo—wise and courageous in life, bringing prosperity to the family and peace to the land."

"Now, though your spirits have departed to the underworld, may your souls rest in peace and continue to protect our Ning family."

Upon hearing this, many were deeply moved.

In the hall draped in mourning white, the sound of weeping grew louder as mournful music played.

"My husband! My son!" Wang Lan cried in agony before fainting.

Ning Zhuo was startled and rushed to help her. His pure filial piety and personal attention moved the onlookers, with some whispering their admiration.

Even though Ning Zhuo's cultivation was still lower than expected, many now viewed him as a worthy branch leader, a figure of genuine virtue and filial piety.

Yang Chanyu, hidden in the shadows, watched with a sneer, muttering, "Rest in peace? Weren’t these people killed by him? How could they ever rest in peace?"

"How hypocritical! That little brother of yours is way too fake." She scoffed, disdainfully shaking her head.

Sun Lingtong, also hidden, rolled his eyes. "What do you know? This is how the righteous path operates."
