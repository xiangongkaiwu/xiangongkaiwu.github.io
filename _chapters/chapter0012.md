# Chapter 331: Look at Ning Zhuo!

In front of Zhou Nongying, Fei Si also tried to win over Ning Zhuo.


Ning Zhuo behaved indifferently, which was almost the opposite of his past self.


Naturally, Zhou Nongying was very satisfied with his attitude. He knew that Ning Zhuo, this junior, was brilliant and knew the current situation, who the allies were, and who the enemies were.


At present, the Lava Fairy Palace belonged to the Meng family.


Meng Kui would definitely not let go of it easily. In time, relying on the Lava Fairy Palace as a key support point, the Meng family will have a nearly perfect reason to continue to send Meng family cultivators to the Fire Persimmon Fairy City.


In the end, the city would be taken over by the Meng family according to the plan.


Under such circumstances, the Zhou and Ning families naturally had to unite to fight against the ambitious Meng family.


Seeing Ning Zhuo like this, Fei Si didn't want to stay any longer and left early.


Ning Zhuo was very polite and accompanied him all the way to the gate.


Before leaving, Fei Si smiled and mentioned Chi Dun. He said that Chi Dun, a physical cultivator, had been obsessed with Buddhist doctor Meng Yaoyin since the monster tide was extinguished and had a strong desire to challenge her to a duel to regain his ground and calm his resentment.


Ning Zhuo also smiled slightly. He immediately realized that Fei Si was using Chi Dun to threaten him.


Since that was the case, he didn’t cave into the other party and replied: "I may be young and weak, but I have a competitive nature. Since Lord Chi Dun has such a desire, then this junior is willing to accompany him to the end. I’m just worried... that if the Night Rain Demon Weapon is not handled with due care, Lord Chi Dun will die. That would be terrible!"


Fei Si immediately stopped smiling, nodded indifferently to Ning Zhuo, then turned around and walked away.


Looking at Fei Si's back, Ning Zhuo's eyes were dim, knowing that at this point, his close relationship with Fei Si had disappeared and the two sides were standing on opposite sides.


"Lord Zhu Hou, the director of the Salesian Garden, has arrived!" The receptionist recited loudly again and then recited the list of gifts that Zhu Hou brought.


A great earthquake has once again struck the hearts of many people!


Although Zhu Hou was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, he was born into the royal family of Nandou, and he had a high status. In particular, the royal family had inserted him here to act as a nail, observe the situation in the fairy city, and try to offset Meng Kui's influence.


Ning Zhuo had just returned from the gate when he heard the recitation. He turned around and greeted Zhu Hou with a warm smile.


Zhu Hou is different from others.


He first entered the buffet, which immediately caused a sensation.


He visited the banquet many times and made many good friends before leaving to discuss things with Ning Zhuo and Zhou Nongying.


This time he represents the Nandou royal family and wants to support the Ningzhuo branch family and the Zhou family, hoping that they can stop the Meng family from encroaching on Fire Persimmon Immortal City in the future.


The three of them had a very pleasant conversation and strongly expressed their desire to cooperate.


After the crowd dispersed, Ning Zhuo returned to the banquet.


After he sat down at the main table, the cultivators who had been waiting anxiously came forward and took the initiative to toast Ning Zhuo.


The first to bear the brunt were Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun, the two former elders of the branch.


Ning Zhuo is now the head of a branch family, and his status far exceeds that of the two elders.


Ning Youfu showed an obvious attitude of submission, and Ning Houjun's attitude was even lower because he had other requests. He hoped that his blood descendants could return to Ning Zhuo's branch family and be pardoned for the crimes that had led to their exile.


This simple response made Ning Houjun's eyes red, and he was deeply moved.


Ning Zhuo didn't agree immediately, but said that he had to observe it carefully before making a judgment.


"When the family is divided in the future, I still hope that you two elders can serve as the pillars of the family and provide shelter for the future generations for a period of time." Ning Zhuo took the initiative to invite.


Ning Youfu and Ning Houjun looked at each other and agreed on the spot. They had stepped down from the position of family elders not entirely out of their own will.


The academy elder standing by had a gloomy face, but he had no choice but to watch helplessly and indignantly as the Ning Zhuo branch family absorbed branch members in person, expanded rapidly, and strengthened itself.


Ning Xiangqian and other former deacons also came to Ning Zhuo, eagerly hoping that Ning Zhuo's division of the family would include them all.


Ning Zhuo said that the list will be made public soon.


After that, there were classmates and reform team members such as Ning Chen and Ning Yong.


Ning Zhuo encouraged them. He had always been very famous among this group of people, mainly due to his previous teaching experience.


Now, his position as the head of the branch family has been confirmed, completely surpassing them. This further stimulated their desire to follow him.


The leaders of the Monkey Head Gang and Crane Mouth Gang came and sat in the corner.


Even so, they were trembling with excitement.


This was what they had been dreaming about before they joined Ning Zhuo. As Ning Zhuo's status rose, they also benefited from it and truly mixed into the circle of the right path.


They personally experienced Zhou Nongying, Fei Si, Zhu Hou and others coming to congratulate them, and their loyalty to Ning Zhuo immediately increased a hundredfold.


Chen Cha, Feng Heizi, and the One-armed Craftsman also left the table one after another and walked over to express their congratulations.


Chen Cha had a complicated expression and sighed: "Ning Zhuo, if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I would never have expected you to be able to do this. Congratulations!!"


Ning Zhuo stood up and held Chen Cha's hand, showing extraordinary closeness, which aroused the envy of Feng Heizi and the one-armed craftsman.


"At that time, the Ning family clan leader was still alive, and had asked to comment on Ning Zhuo's explosive mechanism.


At the banquet, Feng Jiqing boasted to the monks sitting at the same table.


"When I first saw it, I was stunned! Apart from other things, the storage array is perfectly designed. I would choose the cloud whale's air lungs if it were me.


"Hahaha, compared to this gifted child, I am too ordinary and not worth mentioning."


"It is my great honor to be in the same city with Master Ning Zhuo.


Lava Fairy Palace.


Meng Kui floated slightly in the air, sitting above the circular pit where the throne once stood.


In front of him, a magic mirror was formed, reflecting the location of Ning Zhuo's family.


He could see everything.


However, there was only one protagonist in the mirror, Ning Zhuo. Meng Kui observed the young man in white with deep eyes.


Before the dust settled, he would never believe that such a junior would defeat him.


Who could have thought that in this Huoshi Mountain, there was a young cultivator at the Qi Refining level who could disguise and endure for more than ten years, and temporarily deceive all forces to seize the Lava Fairy Palace and the Bomb Fairy Palace?


"Grandpa!" Meng Chong broke open the main hall door and rushed to Meng Kui.


"Is Ning Zhuo opening his mansion today? I'm going to fight him! I haven't lost yet!!" Meng Chong shouted loudly, threatening to take revenge.


Meng Chong snorted coldly and flicked his fingers lightly. The strong force of his fingers made Meng Chong shrink his head, cover his forehead with his hands, and cry out in pain.


"Grandpa, why did you hit me?"


Meng Kui: "I told you to practice diligently and master a few more cultivation skills, but you never listened to my advice."


"Did you see it this time too?"


"Ning Zhuo relied on his mastery of mechanical engineering to leave you several blocks behind. The mechanical monkey you regarded as your lifelong enemy was just one of his creations. In the end, he took the initiative to give up the position of Palace Master to your grandfather!"


"Look at her, she's only sixteen years old, younger than you."


"You are so young, but you failed at the last moment and his puppet extracted your soul. You are so young, but you have such skills and excellent mechanical attainments, and you have even separated and established your own business today."


"Chong'er, learn more from geniuses who are better than you!"


Meng Chong was stunned.


Grandpa Meng Kui has always been proud of him. But at this moment, he said such words, which made Meng Chong feel strange. You know, in the past, he, Meng Chong, was the only protagonist in such words.


Now, Ning Zhuo successfully pushed Meng Chong down.


"Well, Chong'er's defeat this time is understandable. Even if it was you and me, weren't we fooled by that cunning kid?" Meng Hu showed up.


He walked behind Meng Chong and lifted him up: "I will take Chong'er away first. Although the three sects' upper method builds the foundation of the three dantians, it focuses on mechanical arts, and the opportunity has been lost, so it is not suitable for Chong'er."


"It just so happens that the Imperial Master Wu Ting of the Xianglei Kingdom is openly recruiting disciples. Chong'er has the talent to be a mad thunderbolt. If he becomes Imperial Master Xianglei's disciple, the result will be even better."


Meng Kui nodded: "Okay, let's take him there."


No matter how Meng Chong struggled and shouted, Meng Hu picked him up, turned into a rainbow and flew away.


Meng Kui was left alone, sighing quietly.


If he could have the complete three sects' methods, it would be a good option for Meng Chong to stay and continue practicing.


But there was only one copy of the Three Laws Scripture in the body of the Mechanical Taoist Master. The soul entering the Immortal Palace can only obtain the three sects of the Qi Refining Period.


The subsequent skills were hidden in the Dharma Bell, but Meng Kui faced many difficulties in cracking the bell and had no idea where to start!


Meng Kui, who was well versed in the mystery of fate, knew that the fate of Lava Fairy Palace had been taken by others first. One step behind and the subsequent fate would only benefit those who took it first.




It is extremely difficult for Meng Chong to catch up, and he has already lost the initiative, wasted time, and made little progress. It would be better for him to make a bold move, decisively withdraw, and take another path.


His spiritual consciousness scattered, and Meng Chong observed the Lava Fairy Palace again.


"The loss is too heavy!" He shook his head.


Deep down, he didn't want to take over this mess.


But there is no way, because the Meng family has plans for Fire Persimmon Immortal City.


The Meng family needs a reason to take over the Fire Persimmon Fairy City in order to maintain control for a long time.


There was a nationwide policy of rotating city lords from the Nandou royal family.


The identity of the Lava Palace Master can undoubtedly help the Meng family achieve this goal.


This was why, even though Meng Kui, a wise general, knew that this was a trap, he still wanted to fulfill Ning Zhuo's wish, took the initiative and took on the responsibility.


"Rebuilding the entire Lava Fairy Palace is incredibly expensive. We can only do it with the help of our family." Although Meng Kui is at the Nascent Soul stage, he cannot afford the maintenance of the Fairy Palace by himself. This shows how huge the cost of repairing the Fairy Palace is.


What troubled Meng Kui was not the repair problem, but his position within the Lava Immortal Palace.


The Lava Immortal Palace has various positions. Even though the mechanical buildings had fallen, the positions weren’t cancelled with them.


According to the agreement between Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji, no matter who obtains the position of Palace Master of the Immortal Palace, these positions wouldn't be liquidated.


Therefore, even though Meng Kui was the palace master, a large number of duties fell on the cultivators of the joint reform teams.


The existence of these people, who controlled many positions in the Immortal Palace, will undoubtedly greatly reduce the Meng family's control over the Lava Immortal Palace!


This is also the most important foundation for Zhou Nongying and Ning Zhuo to join forces to fight against the Meng family.


-! The banquet was almost over when the receptionist suddenly called out: "Master Song Fuli has arrived!"


Separate families.


Ning Zhuo was slightly stunned, knowing that an unwelcome guest had arrived.


Song Fuli had a blank expression on his face and stood straight. He neither gave any gifts nor wanted to step into the door.




He blocked the door.
