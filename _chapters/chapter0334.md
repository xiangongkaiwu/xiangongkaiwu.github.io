# Chapter 334: Breaking the Situation

“That little brat! When you come back, I’ll hang you up and spank you ’til your butt turns red!” Ning Jiufan gritted his teeth in anger.

A flying letter suddenly knocked against the window like a bird.

With a sweep of his spirit sense, Ning Jiufan opened the window and let the letter in.

It was a message from Ning Zhuo.

“Ancestor, by the time you read this letter, I’ve probably already run away from home…”

The contents of the letter were mostly about Ning Zhuo’s thoughts on the current situation of Fire Persimmon Immortal City, talking about the Ning family as well as the ongoing power struggle between the Zhu family and Meng family.

Ning Zhuo’s prediction was this: Soon, a huge conflict would break out over the positions in the Lava Immortal Palace, with the Ning family and Zhou family facing the Meng family. Oh, there was also the Grand Purity Palace.

The Grand Purity Palace had brought away a group of Zheng family cultivators, many of whom held positions in the Immortal Palace. Ning Zhuo firmly believed that this super sect had yet to give up its designs on the Lava Immortal Palace.

It could be possible to take advantage of this.

The letter also mentioned that Ning Zhuo had left behind some resources which would soon be delivered to Ning Jiufan. This was meant to compensate and repay the main family for raising him thus far.

In the final part of the letter, Ning Zhuo reminded Ning Jiufan that he hand’t left behind any mechanical constructs, so it would be up to Ning Jiufan to take care of the branch family. Moreover, Ning Zhuo also said that although the Fire-Melting Demon Ape could be subdued through techniques and magical artifacts, such a course of action wasn’t recommended.

According to him, the correct path was to foster loyalty through a close relationship!

After finishing the letter, much of Ning Jiufan’s anger had already disappeared. Sighing to himself, he muttered, “This brat… in the end, he’s still willing to protect the family.

“Not just that, he even dares to meddle in the matters of his ancestor! Hmph! 

“Wait… could it be that this letter is also part of his plans? Did he factor in my anger as well?”

Ning Jiufan’s brow furrowed in uncertainty.

He couldn’t deny that during the struggle over Lava Immortal Palace, Ning Zhuo’s patience, cunning, and other qualities had left a lasting impression on him.

It was even to the point that he, a Golden Core cultivator, was now doubting himself, wondering if Ning Zhuo was tricking him again as part of another scheme.

After pondering for a moment, Ning Jiufan exhaled deeply, resolving not to overthink.

“There’s no point in thinking too much.

“Ning Zhuo is inherently righteous and loyal to the family. Although he’s a little sly, he has a bottom line. A talent like this needs to be further honed.”

Coming to this conclusion, Ning Jiufan thought about how to further solidify Ning Zhuo’s status in the family. Perhaps when he granted posthumous titles to the sacrificed Ning family members, he could emphasize Ning Zhuo’s contributions to tie him to the family more closely.

“Aside from that, when the family offers sacrifices to communicate with the underworld, I should personally beg the ancestors to grant higher blessings to Ning Zhuo.”

Meanwhile, at the City Lord’s Mansion…

“Ning Zhuo is gone? He used a Nascent Soul-level mechanical construct to escape… Did it come from the Lava Immortal Palace?”

Reading the report, Fei Si felt a wave of relief sweep through him.

How could he sleep peacefully with a formidable enemy next to his bed?

Although Ning Zhuo’s cultivation level was low, his military might and cunning mind had left those in the know deeply wary.

Fei Si was no exception.

The following afternoon, Zhu Xuanji departed from Fire Persimmon Immortal City as well. As he flew into the sky, he couldn’t help but take one last look.

Fire Persimmon Mountain loomed beneath him, its jagged peaks like an awakening giant. After the violent eruption, the cooled lava at the lower portions of the mountain had formed patches of red-and-white ground.

The remnants of the lava’s flow resembled massive winding veins, a testament to nature’s fury.

Further up the mountain was the vast sprawl of buildings that made up Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Although some parts were damaged, the city as a whole was relatively intact.

Thanks to the citizens’ unity and resolve, the crisis that was the beast tide was ultimately averted.

Orchards full of persimmon trees could be found at the very base of the mountain. Although the next Fire Persimmon Festival was still some months away, the city’s defensive formation had absorbed a surge of heat from the volcanic eruption, ensuring that the next harvest would be abundant.

On formerly bare tree branches, large clusters of persimmons now hung. The round, red fruits seemed to represent the hope of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

However, the city’s future outlook seemed as mysterious and uncertain as the heavy clouds hanging over the mountaintop, ambiguous but not necessarily ominous.

Zhu Xuanji’s eyes flashed with golden light, piercing through the clouds and gazing upon the volcano’s crater, where the Lava Immortal Palace floated atop the molten rock.

The palace was currently undergoing reconstruction, with Meng Kui personally leading the effort. He used spells to retrieve fragments of the palace that had fallen into the lava, while numerous other cultivators worked alongside him to gradually piece the broken palace back together.

“Three Schools Supreme Sage…” Zhu Xuanji’s expression revealed a trace of fear.

These days, whenever he had a moment for reflection, his mind involuntarily replayed the scene of that last critical moment, when he turned against Meng Kui and aided Ning Zhuo.

In that moment, as if guided by some invisible force, he had used his Golden Phoenix Mirror to target Meng Kui’s spell hand.

This singular action had put the Southern Bean royal family completely at odds with Meng Kui, as well as preventing him from dealing a lethal blow to Ning Zhuo.

“Back then, was it truly my own decision to assist Ning Zhuo? Or… was I already under his influence?”

In the past few days, Zhu Xuanji recalled that critical moment again and again. His heart was full of unease, feeling as if he had been manipulated like a puppet on strings.

But as time passed and he continued to remember that scene, his suspicions blurred. At times, he was even convinced that it had merely been an instinctive action where his body reacted faster than his mind.

After replaying that scene in his mind countless times, Zhu Xuanji found himself doubting everything. As Fire Persimmon Immortal City gradually faded into the distance behind him, he couldn’t help but reach up and touch the top of his head.

“That day… was there a Life-Hanging Thread attached to me?”

He didn’t feel anything.

Zhu Xuanji suddenly recalled a past scene from the royal capital. It was a line spoken by the Three Schools Supreme Sage, and it grew increasingly chilling the more he thought about it.

At that time, the Southern Bean Empress had just retrieved her golden mirror.

The Three Schools Supreme Sage had said, “Fate is fate. Since you’ve taken the golden mirror, I’ll let you guard the Immortal Palace for a while.”

Strangely, the further Zhu Xuanji flew from Fire Persimmon Mountain, the more calm and peaceful he felt.

It was as though a wild beast had escaped a giant trap!

A chilling sense of danger arose in his heart.

“Fire Persimmon Immortal City, Lava Immortal Palace… something is definitely off.”

Zhu Xuanji had a strong feeling that he should stay as far away from these places as he could.

“And that Ning Zhuo too! I must limit my interactions with him as much as possible. After all, he is the one chosen by the Three Schools Supreme Sage – the child of destiny for the Buddha-Demon War.”

After Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, and the others left, Fire Persimmon Immortal City gradually returned to its peaceful atmosphere.

With no more scarlet flame monster beasts rampaging and the Lava Immortal Palace having obtained a master, the many visitors also began leaving Fire Persimmon Mountain.

Inside the city, in the Flying Disk Workshop…

A gray-haired old man in white robes sat in a mechanical chair, cultivating his magical power.

The chair was floating a few feet off the ground.

His eyes were sunken, his breathing deep—it was Chen Cha.

Suddenly, Chen Cha’s body trembled violently, as if he had been struck by lightning. His eyes abruptly flew open.

Both his pupils and his irises were gone, leaving only an eerie whiteness.

And wisps of white smoke slowly drifted out from the whites of those eyes.

Chen Cha seemed like a completely different person as he swung his head around, scanning his surroundings before focusing in on the direction of the Lava Immortal Palace.

His fingers moved slowly but surely, leaving mystical afterimages in the air.

As he calculated, the white smoke coming from his eyes grew thicker. Right now, Chen Cha had an ethereal visage, like an immortal shrouded in fog.

“Zhu Xuanji should have stayed to guard the Immortal Palace. Why did he leave?

“And Meng Chong too! He’s gone!

“This whole situation was engineered by the Three Schools Supreme Sage. Logically speaking, there shouldn’t be any room for mistakes. The Immortal Palace had the Life-Hanging Thread divine ability, it should have been completely foolproof! How come thigns have turned out like this? Just who is behind all this?

“Now that this setup is ruined, most of my plans for the Southern Bean Kingdom will be ruined as well. What a headache. How can I fix this?”

After finishing his calculations, Chen Cha seemed distressed.

“Was it Ning Zhuo? He was the one who messed everything up?

“For now, my top priority is locating Zhu Xuanji and Ning Zhuo to find the root of the problem.”

Thinking to this point, Chen Cha slowly closed his eyes.

The white smoke filling the room quickly disappeared.

His breathing returned to normal, and he resumed his cultivation.

After an incense stick’s worth of time, Chen Cha opened his eyes once again. This time, his irises and pupils had returned. His magical power fully replenished, Chen Cha began studying some books on mechanical arts.

Before leaving the city, Ning Zhuo had specifically arranged for these books to be delivered to Chen Cha.

“Meeting Ning Zhuo was my good fortune,” Chen Cha thought. His heart was filled with gratitude as he rapidly absorbed the knowledge in the books.

He seemed completely unaware of the strange incident that had just occurred, with no memory of it whatsoever!
