# Chapter 333: Myriad Li Wandering Dragon Leaves the Immortal City!

Zhu Xuanji said, “The specific content of the reward is this: Sun Lingtong and Yang Chanyu will have their arrest warrants cancelled, and Sun Lingtong will be granted a chance to choose an item from the royal treasury.”

Ning Zhuo’s face immediately fell, unable to help himself from speaking in disappointment. “This, this, this…”

He had been so full of anticipation, but the Southern Bean royal family was unexpectedly shrewd. Whether it was the explanation or the reward, both were just right, but both left Ning Zhuo himself bereft of any benefits.

After explaining the royal decree, Zhu Xuanji immediately stood up and said, “Let me tell you one last thing. Do not let anyone know of that scripture that can extract spirituality. Even if it’s a Buddhist scripture, it’s too reminiscent of the techniques of the Corpse Spirit Sect.”

Ning Zhuo hurriedly tried to stop Zhu Xuanji from leaving. “Lord Zhu, are you leaving right now? Please stay for while, there’s a little banquet that I’ve prepared specially for you…”

Zhu Xuanji ignored him and left.

Ning Zhuo chased after him, taking out a magical artifact and stuffing it into Zhu Xuanji’s hand. “Hehe, this is just a small token of my respect.”

Looking down, Zhu Xuanji saw that it was the Jade Dragon Mirror, which was part of a set along with the Golden Phoenix Mirror that he’d obtained.

Part of the agreement among the three sides was to divide up the magical artifacts floating in the main hall. This Jade Dragon Mirror was what Ning Zhuo had received.

Zhu Xuanji quickly pulled back his arm and shouted in fury, “You actually want to bribe me? I am the divine constable, Zhu Xuanji! How could I accept your bribe! You bastard, how dare you look down on me!?

“Humph, you are indeed the same kind of bastard as Sun Lingtong. Birds of a feather!”

Ning Zhuo wasn’t frightened at all and maintained his smile. “Don’t be nervous, Lord Zhu. This matter will only be known to you, me, heaven, and earth-”

Zhu Xuanji directly flew into the sky, turning into an arc of light and disappearing without hesitation.

Ning Zhuo looked in the direction of his departure and sighed. “How could he leave so quickly? I was hoping to trade for the Demon General.”

Back then, Ning Zhuo, Zhu Xuanji, and Meng Kui had divided up the three Golden Core-level mechanical constructs – the Buddhist Healer, the Demon General, and the Daoist Master.

Ning Zhuo blinked in confusion as a thought suddenly occurred to him. “Why does it feel like Zhu Xuanji doesn’t dare to face me? He seems a bit panicked?”

But he quickly shook his head, figuring that he was just a hallucination.

“If we really fought, I wouldn’t be able to beat Zhu Xuanji.

“I’ve already exposed all my trump cards. Although my mother’s spirituality has recovered greatly, each time she uses a spell or the Giant Snake Scythe, it’ll consume a lot of spirituality.”

The most powerful mechanical construct in Ning Zhuo’s hands was undoubtedly the Buddhist Healer. However, he would never use her lightly!

The more of her spirituality remained, the longer she could hold out. As long as she still had even a little bit of spirituality, there was hope.

In fact, Ning Zhuo hadn’t been hallucinating. Zhu Xuanji was indeed reluctant to come into contact with him.

Zhu Xuanji didn’t fear Ning Zhuo, nor did he fear the Giant Snake Scythe. What he feared was the Buddha Heart Demon Seal!

Flying in the air, Zhu Xuanji’s face was grim.

The late emperor’s final words had explained that the Buddha Heart Demon Seal was related to the conflict between the Buddha World and the Demon World. Its karmic implications were extraordinarily heavy.

Zhu Xuanji certainly didn’t wish to get involved and could only choose to run far away.

This was also the primary reason why Ning Zhuo wasn’t given an official position or any rewards. If he really became an official of the Southern Bean Kingdom, the royal family would most likely perish. They weren’t able to bear the consequences of being caught between the Buddha World and Demon World!

In short, it was best to keep a distance from Ning Zhuo and watch from afar.

This was a good thing for Zhu Xuanji himself, and it was also a good thing for the entire Southern Bean Kingdom!

Not long after Zhu Xuanji left, Ning Jiufan quietly arrived.

“Ancestor, I’ve been looking forward to seeing your elderly face.” Ning Zhuo’s expression was full of sincerity.

He was extremely grateful to Ning Jiufan for speaking up for him and removing Ning Qingqiao from the position of family elder. This matter had cleared away any obstacles in the family and allowed the branch family to be established smoothly.

Ning Jiufan snorted coldly. “What else could I do? Let the main family continue oppressing you and give you a legitimate reason to destroy them?”

Ning Zhuo’s expression immediately changed. He swore up and down that he could never be so heartless and indifferent.

“Although I may have been treated a little badly, I was able to grow up without any issues. I still respect the main family, and would never try to deal with them using such drastic means. After all, we share the same blood. No matter what, they’re all my relatives,” Ning Zhuo sighed.

Ning Jiufan snorted coldly. “Ning Xiaohui, Ning Xiaoren… weren’t they your relatives, too? I may be old, but I’m not muddled. I heard that one of your mechanical constructs is a pair of arms?”

Ning Zhuo quickly coughed. “Ancestor, let me congratulate you. With the support of the royal family, you will be able to subdue that demon ape. Our Ning family will become a powerful force with military might at the Nascent Soul level!

“Sigh, I also spoke secretly with Lord Zhu Xuanji just now, but the royal family didn’t give me any rewards. I didn’t even get a position as an official.”

Ning Zhuo spread his hands, giving off a strong feeling of grievance.

Ning Jiufan coughed a few times, knowing that Ning Zhuo was using this matter as a bargaining chip for negotiation.

Sighing, he looked deeply at Ning Zhuo and spoke. “The past is a mess. It’s useless to dwell on it now.”

Ning Zhuo strongly agreed.

Just a moment ago, Ning Jiufan had clearly exposed him for murdering Ning Xiaohui and the others. But now, the ancestor moved on from the topic, saying, “Your letter mentioned that you want to leave Fire Persimmon Immortal City?”

Ning Zhuo bowed and said, “Ancestor, I’ve lived in Fire Persimmon Immortal City for over ten years and am eager to travel the world. As the saying goes, reading Myriads of books will lead to traveling Myriads of li. This world is vast, and I can’t wait to see it with my own eyes.”

Ning Jiufan stroked his beard. After thinking for a moment, he said, “Indeed. You’re too outstanding, and Meng Kui definitely remembers your face after you gave up the position of palace master. It’s better for you to stay out of the limelight for a while.”

Ning Jiufan wasn’t worried about Ning Zhuo’s personal safety.

On the one hand, Ning Zhuo’s total military might was stronger than his own. If even someone with Golden Core-level power at his fingertips couldn’t travel, then the world would be too dangerous.

On the other hand, Ning Jiufan was even more confident thanks to Ning Zhuo’s strategies and tactics. Even he, the young man’s ancestor, had been deceived. With this sort of demon-like mind, what was there to worry about?

“When are you leaving?” Ning Jiufan asked.

Ning Zhuo said, “Half a month at the earliest.”

He said that he needed to consolidate his cultivation. At the same time, he had to make sure that the new branch family was stabilized.

“Before you leave, remember to leave behind a mechanical construct to take care of your family,” Ning Jiufan reminded. “I think that mechanical monkey is pretty good.”

In order to gain Ning Jiufan’s support, Ning Zhuo had revealed a lot to him. Actually, the cooperation between the three parties meant that Ning Zhuo had no choice; if he didn’t say anything, Zhu Xuanji certainly would.

From then on, Ning Zhuo began living a reclusive life.

The Flying Cloud Caravan left, but Song Fuli brought two Golden Core cultivators and returned in secret, hiding in the nearby mountains.

Luo Shang scattered ghost soldiers and ghost generals all around the city, waiting together with Han Ming.

Yang Chanyu stuck to Sun Lingtong all day, continuously urging him to bid farewell to Ning Zhuo and return to the Void Sect with her as soon as possible.

She had profited greatly this time.

After Ning Zhuo reached an agreement with Meng Kui and Zhu Xuanji, he had obtained many things from the Immortal Palace. He also reaped quite a harvest from what the Zheng family left behind, and received plenty of gifts during the establishment of his branch family.

Among these gifts, Ning Zhuo took out a Golden Core-level Rainbow Auspicious Cloud and gave it to Yang Chanyu. Yang Chanyu was very satisfied with this, but she was also worried about the journey home.

Even if she couldn’t detect Song Fuli, Luo Shang, and the others, she knew that the Soul Devouring Sect had a life-and-death feud with her and Sun Lingtong. The way back to the Void Sect would definitely be fraught with danger!

One day, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong secretly met each other in an underground base.

Glancing around, Sun Lingtong laughed. His face was emotional as he said, “In a few years, these secret bases will no longer exist.”

The defensive formation of Fire Persimmon Immortal City had many loopholes. This was because the Lava Immortal Palace had to be taken into consideration; the city lord didn’t want to affect the palace inside Fire Persimmon Mountain, so the city’s defensive formation was constructed somewhat loosely.

But now, Meng Kui had become the palace master and could incorporate the entire Immortal Palace into the city’s defensive formation, making it the core of the formation.

Thus, the defensive formation would soon be re-established and monitored carefully. The current loopholes would be fixed, and finding more loopholes would become extremely difficult.

Unlike Sun Lingtong, Ning Zhuo didn’t care about the underground bases at all. Turning to his companion, he said, “Let’s go, Boss.”

Concealing themselves, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong warped through base after base. In the end, they arrived deep inside Fire Persimmon Mountain.

They stopped inside certain tunnel.

“It’s here.” Ning Zhuo controlled a mechanical explosive monkey to continuously scratch at the ground. Soon, the monkey pulled out a tiny and exquisite mechanical dragon.

Even stretched to its fullest extent, this mechanical dragon was no larger than the palm of Ning Zhuo’s hand. Its color was a drab gray, and it looked very inconspicuous.

However, Ning Zhuo knew very well that this was a mechanical construct at the Nascent Soul level – the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon!

After scanning it with his spirit sense, Ning Zhuo’s expression lit up with joy. “Great, just as expected. The Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit is in here, too!”

Sun Lingtong was overjoyed when he heard Ning Zhuo’s words. “Earlier, the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit proactively courted death. Did it really think that we’re all idiots? Anyone could see that that matter was extremely bizarre. Haha, Little Zhuo, you finally found it!

“But how on earth did it escape into this little mechanical dragon right under our noses?”

Ning Zhuo said, “This spirit has no fatal weaknesses. Most likely, it used the Immortal Palace’s punishment to split itself into two parts. The main part stayed in the main hall of the palace, deceiving us and rushing to its death. When the main part died, the split-off portion became the only one. It escaped here and fell into a coma.”

Scanning the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit within the little mechanical dragon, he saw that it was seriously injured. It didn’t move at all as it recovered slowly.

Soon, Ning Zhuo and Sun Lingtong successfully activated the mechanical dragon. The size of this Myriad Li Wandering Dragon didn’t change, but two rays of light burst out from its eyes and sucked Sun Lingtong and Ning Zhuo into its body.

“Wonderful, wonderful!” After trying for a while, Sun Lingtong gradually figured out the method to control the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon and shouted with joy.

“Like this, we can directly leave Fire Persimmon Immortal City. Meng Kui can have the position of palace master for now. Let him repair the palace for us, haha!”

Ning Zhuo smiled and nodded.

The reason he had been able to find the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was because when he met it in the main hall previously, he had planted a Life-Hanging Thread on it.

Thus, when the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit was buried in the sea of fire, Ning Zhuo sensed from its Life-Hanging Thread that it had left the hall and continued escaping rapidly.

At that time, Zhu Zhen had been tracking down the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon.

“The authority over the Immortal Palace is split into three parts. Right now, I control the Buddha Heart Demon Seal along with the Dragon Turtle Fire Spirit…”

Surrendering the position of palace master had actually already been part of Ning Zhuo’s calculations.

“The Zhu family wants to rely on my Ning family to face the Meng family, and my Ning family has to rely on me to regain the position of palace master in the future.”

Ning Zhuo smiled and looked at Sun Lingtong, saying, “But, Boss, are you sure there won’t be any trouble if you leave with me?”

Sun Lingtong laughed. “Don’t you know that your boss is a smart person? Back then, I promised that silly woman Yang Chanyu that I would return to the Void Sect with her once the matter of the Lava Immortal Palace was over. However… is the matter over yet?”

Sun Lingtong spread his hands: “No!”

“Alright.” Ning Zhuo nodded, feeling relieved. He subconsciously glanced up in the direction of Fire Persimmon Immortal City.

To Ning Zhuo, this place was where he was born and raised. This was his hometown!

“Farewell, my hometown.” Calling out softly in his heart, he fully activated the mechanical dragon. Its Nascent Soul-level aura was no longer restrained, pulsing outward and immediately attracting numerous gazes.

A moment later, a loud roar echoed out, and the Myriad Li Wandering Dragon twisted its body. Leaving behind an afterimage, it disappeared on the spot.

“You little brat, you even lied to your ancestor!” Ning Jiufan cursed, but a smile hung on his lips.

Ning Zhuo had said that he would stay for at least half a month.

But now, he had run away after only a few days.

A moment later, Ning Jiufan’s smile suddenly froze as he thought of something. “Wait! My Ice Heart Jade Pot is still in his hands! He hasn’t returned it to me yet!”
